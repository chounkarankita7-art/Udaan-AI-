      { id: "be-m-1", question: "How would you design a rate limiting system?", hint: "Token bucket, sliding window, Redis, distributed systems", sampleAnswer: "I'd use a sliding window counter with Redis. Each request increments a key with a TTL. When count exceeds the limit, return 429. For distributed systems, Redis ensures consistency across instances. Libraries like express-rate-limit handle this, but at scale use dedicated API gateway rate limiting.", category: "System Design" },
      { id: "be-m-2", question: "Explain database indexing and when to use it.", hint: "B-tree, read vs write tradeoff, cardinality", sampleAnswer: "Indexes are data structures that speed up lookups at the cost of write performance and storage. Use B-tree indexes on columns used in WHERE, JOIN, ORDER BY with high cardinality. Composite indexes for multi-column queries. Avoid over-indexing — analyze query plans with EXPLAIN.", category: "Databases" },

Solve with eager loading (JOIN in a single query), DataLoader for batching in GraphQL, or manually batching IDs with WHERE id IN (...). Always analyze query counts in development.", category: "Databases" },
    ],
    Senior: [
      { id: "be-s-1", question: "How would you design a scalable notification system?", hint: "Message queues, pub/sub, push/email/SMS, fan-out", sampleAnswer: "I'd use a message queue (Kafka/RabbitMQ) with a pub/sub pattern. Producers emit events; notification service consumers handle different channels (push, email, SMS). Use worker pools for fan-out. Store preferences in DB. Implement retry logic with exponential backoff. Add a delivery status tracker.", category: "System Design" },
      { id: "be-s-2", question: "Explain eventual consistency and when to accept it.", hint: "CAP theorem, BASE, distributed databases", sampleAnswer: "Eventual consistency means replicas converge to the same state given no new updates — but reads may be stale temporarily. Acceptable for: social media likes, product recommendations, analytics. Not acceptable for: banking transactions, inventory counts. Trade off availability vs. consistency based on business requirements.", category: "Distributed Systems" },
      { id: "be-s-3", question: "How do you approach API versioning?", hint: "URL versioning, headers, backwards compatibility", sampleAnswer: "Options: URL versioning (/v1/, /v2/) — simple but URL pollution.

      { id: "mle-j-2", question: "How would you handle missing data in a dataset?", hint: "Drop, impute, model-based imputation, flag", sampleAnswer: "Options: Drop rows/columns if small fraction. Impute with mean/median/mode for numerical/categorical. Use model-based imputation (KNN, MICE). Add a 'missing' indicator column. For time series, forward/backward fill. Choice depends on missingness mechanism (MCAR/MAR/MNAR) and downstream model.", category: "Data Preprocessing" },
      { id: "mle-j-3", question: "What is regularization and why is it important?", hint: "L1, L2, preventing overfitting, penalty term", sampleAnswer: "Regularization adds a penalty to the loss function to discourage complex models. L1 (Lasso) adds |weights| — drives some to zero (feature selection). L2 (Ridge) adds weights² — shrinks all weights. Both prevent overfitting by reducing model complexity. Controlled by the regularization strength hyperparameter λ.", category: "ML Fundamentals" },
      { id: "mle-j-4", question: "What is feature engineering?", hint: "Creating/transforming features to improve model performance", sampleAnswer: "Feature engineering is creating, transforming, or selecting features to improve model performance. Includes: encoding categoricals, scaling numerics, creating interaction features, extracting datetime components, binning, polynomial features, domain-specific transformations. Good features often matter more than model choice.", category: "Feature Engineering" },
      { id: "mle-j-5", question: "Explain the confusion matrix and its derived metrics.", hint: "TP, FP, TN, FN, precision, recall, F1", sampleAnswer: "A confusion matrix shows actual vs. predicted classes. From it: Precision=TP/(TP+FP) (of predicted positives, how many are correct), Recall=TP/(TP+FN) (of actual positives, how many found), F1=harmonic mean of both, Accuracy=(TP+TN)/total.

      { id: "mle-m-4", question: "What is model drift and how do you detect it?", hint: "Data drift, concept drift, monitoring strategy", sampleAnswer: "Model drift: model performance degrades over time. Data drift: input distribution changes. Concept drift: relationship between features and target changes. Detect with: monitoring prediction distributions, tracking metrics on labeled samples, statistical tests (KS test, PSI). Set up alerts and retrain triggers.", category: "MLOps" },
      { id: "mle-m-5", question: "How would you approach an imbalanced classification problem?", hint: "Resampling, class weights, threshold tuning, metrics", sampleAnswer: "Options: resample (oversample minority with SMOTE, undersample majority), class weights in loss function, threshold tuning (optimize for F1 or precision-recall), use appropriate metrics (F1, AUC-PR over accuracy), generate synthetic samples, collect more minority data. Choice depends on dataset and business cost of errors.", category: "ML Fundamentals" },
